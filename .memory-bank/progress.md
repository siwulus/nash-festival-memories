## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (Immediate)

1. **Database Setup**: Choose and configure database solution
2. **User System**: Individual user accounts and sessions
3. **Basic Models**: Users, memories, festivals data structures

### Phase 2: Core Features (Next 2-4 weeks)

1. **Photo Upload**: Basic image upload and display
2. **Memory Creation**: Form to add festival memories with photos
3. **Memory Gallery**: Browse and view shared memories
4. **Festival Categories**: Organize memories by event

### Phase 3: Community Features (Following 4-6 weeks)

1. **User Profiles**: Personal pages and memory collections
2. **Search & Discovery**: Find memories and users
3. **Interactions**: Comments, likes, and social features
4. **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved browsing and filtering

### Phase 4: Polish & Scale (2-3 months)

1. **Performance Optimization**: Image loading and caching
2. **Mobile Experience**: PWA features and mobile optimization
3. **Content Moderation**: Review and approval systems
4. **Analytics & Insights**: Usage tracking and reporting

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Technical Blockers

- **No Database**: Cannot persist user data or memories
- **No File Storage**: Cannot handle photo uploads
- **Single Password**: Not scalable for individual users
- **No Error Monitoring**: Production issues would be invisible

### Product Gaps

- **No Content Strategy**: How to seed initial content
- **No User Onboarding**: How new users discover features
- **No Community Guidelines**: Content standards and moderation
- **No Data Migration**: Strategy for importing existing photos

## Deployment Readiness

### Ready for Deployment

- **✅ Basic Application**: Static pages and authentication work
- **✅ Environment Configuration**: Environment variables supported
- **✅ Build Process**: Production builds successfully

### Deployment Blockers

- **❌ Database Connection**: No persistent data storage configured
- **❌ File Storage**: No solution for user uploads
- **❌ Environment Variables**: Production secrets not configured
- **❌ Domain & Hosting**: No production environment set up

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Choose and implement database solution (PostgreSQL + Prisma recommended)
2. Set up basic user account system with individual authentication
3. Implement photo upload with temporary local storage
4. Create basic memory creation and viewing functionality
5. Deploy to staging environment for testing

The project has a strong foundation and is ready for rapid feature development once the data layer is established.
