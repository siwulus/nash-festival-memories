# Product Context: Nash Festival Memories

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem

Nashville's music festival scene is incredibly vibrant with 25+ annual festivals, but festival memories are scattered across personal devices and social media platforms. There's no centralized place for the Nashville festival community to:

- Share and discover authentic festival experiences
- Connect with fellow music lovers from specific events
- Preserve the rich cultural heritage of Nashville's festival scene
- Find new artists and performances they might have missed

### The Solution

Nash Festival Memories provides a curated, community-driven platform specifically for Nashville festival experiences. Unlike generic social media, it's purpose-built for festival memories with features that understand the unique context of live music events.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Access**: Users enter with a shared password to maintain community quality
2. **Browse**: Explore memories from various Nashville festivals chronologically or by event
3. **Share**: Upload photos and stories from their own festival experiences
4. **Connect**: Find and connect with other attendees from the same events
5. **Discover**: Find new artists and performances through community shares
