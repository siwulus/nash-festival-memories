## Recent Changes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions

- **NextAuth v5**: Chosen for authentication (beta version for Next.js 15 compatibility)
- **DaisyUI**: Selected for consistent, beautiful component library
- **App Router**: Using Next.js 15 App Router architecture
- **Server Components**: Leveraging React Server Components for performance

### Design Decisions

- **Polish Language**: Login interface uses Polish (suggests target audience)
- **Password Protection**: Community curation through shared access

- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile experience

## Immediate Next Steps

### High Priority

1. **Post-Login Dashboard**: Create authenticated user experience
2. **Photo Upload MVP**: Basic image upload and display functionality
3. **Festival Selection**: Interface for categorizing memories by festival
4. **Navigation Enhancement**: Authenticated navigation with logout capability

### Medium Priority

1. **User Profiles**: Individual user pages and preference management
2. **Festival Database**: Structured data for Nashville area festivals
3. **Search & Discovery**: Find memories by festival, date, or artist
4. **Community Features**: Basic commenting and interaction system

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges

- **Media Storage**: Need to decide on image storage solution (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)
- **Database**: No database layer yet - need to choose and implement
- **Performance**: Image optimization and lazy loading for photo-heavy content
- **Security**: Enhance authentication beyond single password

### Product Questions

- **User Management**: How to handle individual user accounts vs. community access?
- **Content Moderation**: Automated or manual review of uploaded content?
- **Festival Data**: Manual curation vs. API integration for festival information?
- **Offline Support**: How much functionality should work without internet?

## Environment Status

- **Development**: Fully functional with hot reload
- **Deployment**: Not yet configured
- **Testing**: No test suite established yet
- **CI/CD**: Not implemented

The project has a solid foundation and is ready for core feature development to begin.
